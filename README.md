# Laps Project
Laps is a visual scripting addon for unity. It lets designers craft memorable levels in minutes. 

# Basic Controls
- If an object in level has a laps component attached to it, it will show up a gizmo that you can drag around.
- If you select a laps component and press S keyboard shortcut, you will see logic slots in scene view.
- You can connect two logic slot if you start dragging from one slot and drop into the other slot.
- You can delete a connection if you click the input slot or the target slot of that connection.
